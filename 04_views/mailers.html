# Action Mailer

Action Mailer is the part of Rails that allows you to send emails.

Mailers go in `app/mailers`. They are similar to controllers and uses views in `app/views`.

For more info:

[http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html)

# Generating A Mailer

We are going to use mailers to implement a forgot password feature for our site.

    .terminal
    $ rails g mailer CustomerMailer password_reset

You can execute this mailer in the rails console like this:

    .terminal
    $ rails c
    Loading development environment (Rails 4.0.0)
    >> CustomerMailer.password_reset.deliver

You will see the email message printed out in the console, but this isn't a very good way to preview email. Let's install mailcatcher to make this better.

---

# Mail Catcher

Mail Catcher is a server that runs on your machine that receives email and then allows you to preview those messages. This is useful fore development and testing because it doesn't matter who these emails are from or to, they all end up in mail catcher.

Mail Catcher is packages as a gem, so to install it, you simply install the gem:

    .terminal
    $ gem install mailcatcher

Then, you have to start up mail catcher:

    .terminal
    $ mailcatcher
    Starting MailCatcher
    ==> smtp://127.0.0.1:1025
    ==> http://127.0.0.1:1080
    *** MailCatcher runs as a daemon by default. Go to the web interface to quit.

If you restart your computer, it will stop running, so you may have to do this again. It's ok if you try to start it again, you will just get this message:

    .terminal
    $ mailcatcher
    Starting MailCatcher
    ~~> ERROR: Something's using port 1025. Are you already running MailCatcher?

Before we can use this, we need to configure Rails to use it.

---

# Configuring Action Mailer

The documentation at [http://mailcatcher.me](http://mailcatcher.me) actually has instructions on how to do this, but all you need to do is add these two lines before the end of the configure block in `config/environments/development.rb`:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = { :address => "localhost", :port => 1025 }
```

Now start a new rails console and send the `password_reset` message again:

    .terminal
    $ rails c
    Loading development environment (Rails 4.0.0)
    >> CustomerMailer.password_reset.deliver
      Rendered customer_mailer/password_reset.text.erb (1.8ms)

Open http://localhost:1080 in another tab

---

# Mail Catcher

You should see something like this:

# Password Reset

To implement password reset, we want to generate a token, then send the user that token in an email, and then if they come back to the site with a valid token, then we mark it as used and allow them to change their password.

So let's generate a model:

    .terminal
    $ rails g model PasswordReset customer:belongs_to token used_at:timestamp
      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20131010204333_create_password_resets.rb
      create    app/models/password_reset.rb
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/models/password_reset_test.rb
      create      test/fixtures/password_resets.yml

---

# Token Generation

Next we can add a method and a before_validation callback to generate a token when a PasswordReset is created:

```ruby
class PasswordReset < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :customer

  before_validation :generate_token
  
  def generate_token
    self.token ||= SecureRandom.hex(16)
  end
end
```

Also add the `has_many` association to the `Customer` model:

```ruby
has_many :password_resets
```

Run `rake db:migrate` to create the `password_resets` database table:

    .terminal
    $ rake db:migrate
    ==  CreatePasswordResets: migrating ===========================================
    -- create_table(:password_resets)
       -> 0.0634s
    ==  CreatePasswordResets: migrated (0.0635s) ==================================

---

# Password Reset

Now let's try out creating a password reset in the console:

    .terminal
    $ rails c
    >> password_reset = Customer.first.password_resets.create
    ...
    >> password_reset.token
    => "05ff0e6a6bfdb0563ad8bf37d5496930"

Looks good!

# In-Class / Homework

Create a `PasswordResetsController` with the following routes/actions:

* GET /forgot_password => new, displays a form with a field to enter your email address to have a password reset created

* POST /forgot_password => create, generates a password reset for the customer is one is found for the given email address, if found, redirects to the form again with a notice saying you should receive an email with instructions on how to reset your password, it not found, renders the form with an alert saying the email was not found

* Update the content of the mailer to have a link to reset the password

* GET /reset_password/:id/:token => edit, displays a form with a password field allowing the user to choose a new one

* POST /reset_password/:id/:token => update, changes the user's password, set the used_at on the password reset to the current time
