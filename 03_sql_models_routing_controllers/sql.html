# SQL

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language for querying Relational DataBase Management Systems (RDBMS) tables for data

---

# RDBMS

A Relational DataBase Management System is a server that stores data in related tables

.center[![Popular RDMBSs](img/rdbms.png)]

---

# Clients for Postgres

## Command Line

    .terminal
    $ psql -U postgres -d betastore_development
    
or launch it based on the database configuration in your Rails app

    .terminal
    $ rails dbconsole

# Tables

A table is a like a spreadsheet with data organized in rows and columns

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# SELECT * from subscriptions;
     id |      email       |         created_at         |         updated_at
    ----+------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------
      1 | test@example.com | 2013-09-24 00:45:24.755576 | 2013-09-24 00:45:24.755576
    (1 row)

A database can have multiple tables and data is organized into tables that relate to each other

## Primary Keys

A primary key is a value that is unique within the table

In Rails, this is always a auto-incrementing integer called `id`, as is the case in this example

---

# Database Normalization

Organizing data into tables in a way that minimizes duplication

## First version of our orders table

    .terminal
    id | customer_name | customer_email     | placed_at  | products         |
    ---+---------------+--------------------+------------+------------------+
    1  | Paul Barry    | mail@paulbarry.com | 2013-09-27 | Muffin, Smoothie |
    2  | Paul Barry    | mail@paulbarry.com | 2013-09-30 | Smoothie         |
    2  | John Doe      | test@example.com   | 2013-09-30 | Muffin, Coffee   |

## Problems

There are multiple products in the products column, which will make it hard to query

The customer name and email are repeated in multiple rows

Database normalization to the rescue!

---

# Each column should contain only one value

    .terminal
    orders
    id | customer_name | customer_email     | placed_at
    ---+---------------+--------------------+-----------
    1  | Paul Barry    | mail@paulbarry.com | 2013-09-27
    2  | Paul Barry    | mail@paulbarry.com | 2013-09-30
    3  | John Doe      | test@example.com   | 2013-09-30

    line_items
    id | order_id | product_name | product_price 
    ---+----------+--------------+--------------
    1  | 1        | Muffin       | 2.99
    2  | 1        | Smoothie     | 3.75
    3  | 2        | Smoothie     | 3.75
    4  | 3        | Muffin       | 2.99
    5  | 3        | Coffee       | 3.99

The `order_id` is called a **foreign key**

Foreign keys are commonly used to create relationships between tables

    .terminal
                        line_items   
    orders              ----------
    --------------      id
    id             <--- order_id
    customer_name       product_name
    customer_email
    placed_at

# Denormalization

                   orders              ----------    
    customers      --------------      id              products
    ---------      id             <--- order_id        --------
    id        <--- customer_id         product_id ---> id
    name           placed_at           quantity        name
    email          total_amount        price           price

Some values will change over time, so you might want to denormalize to record the value that time, as is the case with the `price` column on `line_items`

Sometimes even though values can be calculated, it's better to store them for performance reasons to avoid having to calculate them, as is the case with `total_amount` in `orders`

# Let's Write Some SQL!

Use `rails dbconsole` to bring up the command line client, or use a GUI client

    .terminal
    $ rails dbconsole
    psql (9.2.1)
    Type "help" for help.
    betastore_development=# help
    You are using psql, the command-line interface to PostgreSQL.
    Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
           \h for help with SQL commands
           \? for help with psql commands
           \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
           \q to quit

---

# See what a table looks like

Use the `\?` command to get a list of psql commands:

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# \?
    ...
           \d[S+]                 list tables, views, and sequences
           \d[S+]  NAME           describe table, view, sequence, or index           
    ...

These are psql-specific commands, other clients and databases have different ones.

See what the **orders** table looks like:

.small[

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# \d orders;
                                          Table "public.orders"
        Column    |            Type             |                      Modifiers
    --------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------
     id           | integer                     | not null default nextval('orders_id_seq'::regclass)
     customer_id  | integer                     |
     placed_at    | timestamp without time zone |
     total_amount | numeric                     |
     created_at   | timestamp without time zone |
     updated_at   | timestamp without time zone |
    Indexes:
        "orders_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
        "index_orders_on_customer_id" btree (customer_id)

]

# Queries

Queries are made up of keywords, which I've put in CAPITAL LETTERS in the examples, which is a convention some people follow when writing SQL by hand. The 4 main types are queries are:

1. SELECT - For retrieving data

2. INSERT - For creating new rows

3. UPDATE - For updating existing rows

4. DELETE - For removing rows

---

# Select

`SELECT` queries are used to retrieve data

```sql
SELECT <column_names> FROM <table_name>
```

Use a `SELECT` query to get all of the orders

```sql
SELECT id, customer_id, placed_at FROM orders
```

Execute the query in `psql`:

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# SELECT id, customer_id, placed_at FROM orders;
     id | customer_id |         placed_at
    ----+-------------+----------------------------
      1 |           1 | 2013-09-27 00:00:00
      2 |           1 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.112671
      3 |           2 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.117622
    (3 rows)
    betastore_development=# SELECT * FROM orders;
    ...

You can use `*` in place of column names to get them all

---

# Where

Use the `WHERE` clause to filter the rows that are returned

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# SELECT id, customer_id, placed_at
    betastore_development-# FROM orders WHERE placed_at > '2013-09-30';
     id | customer_id |         placed_at
    ----+-------------+----------------------------
      2 |           1 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.112671
      3 |           2 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.117622
    (2 rows)
    
A query can be separated on multiple lines and must end with a `;`

---

# Limit

Use `LIMIT` to control how many rows are returned:

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# SELECT id, customer_id, placed_at
    betastore_development-# FROM orders LIMIT 1;
     id | customer_id |      placed_at
    ----+-------------+---------------------
      1 |           1 | 2013-09-27 00:00:00
    (1 row)

`LIMIT` can be combined with `WHERE`:

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# SELECT id, customer_id, placed_at
    betastore_development-# FROM orders WHERE placed_at > '2013-09-30'
    betastore_development-# LIMIT 1;
     id | customer_id |         placed_at
    ----+-------------+----------------------------
      2 |           1 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.112671
    (1 row)

---

# Order

Use `order` to control the order the rows are returned in

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# SELECT id, customer_id, placed_at
    betastore_development-# FROM orders ORDER BY placed_at desc;
     id | customer_id |         placed_at
    ----+-------------+----------------------------
      3 |           2 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.117622
      2 |           1 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.112671
      1 |           1 | 2013-09-27 00:00:00
    (3 rows)

The opposite of `desc` is `asc`, but it is the default and can be omitted:

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# SELECT id, customer_id, placed_at
    betastore_development-# FROM orders ORDER BY placed_at;
     id | customer_id |         placed_at
    ----+-------------+----------------------------
      1 |           1 | 2013-09-27 00:00:00
      2 |           1 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.112671
      3 |           2 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.117622
    (3 rows)

---

# Order

Can also be combined with WHERE and LIMIT:

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# SELECT id, customer_id, placed_at
    betastore_development-# FROM orders WHERE placed_at > '2013-09-30'
    betastore_development-# ORDER BY placed_at LIMIT 1;
     id | customer_id |         placed_at
    ----+-------------+----------------------------
      2 |           1 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.112671
    (1 row)

You can order by multiple columns:

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# SELECT id, customer_id, placed_at
    betastore_development-# FROM orders ORDER BY customer_id desc, placed_at;
     id | customer_id |         placed_at
    ----+-------------+----------------------------
      3 |           2 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.117622
      1 |           1 | 2013-09-27 00:00:00
      2 |           1 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.112671
    (3 rows)

---

# Joins

Each order is related to a customer via the the `customer_id` foreign key:

    .terminal
                   orders
    customers      ------
    ---------      id
    id        <--- customer_id
    name           placed_at
    email

We want to get data from both of these tables in one query:

    .terminal
    customers                            
     id |    name      
    ----+------------  
      1 | Paul Barry   
      2 | John Doe     
      3 | Nowhere Man  

    orders
     id | customer_id | placed_at 
    ----+-------------+--------------------
      1 |           1 | 2013-09-27 00:00:00
      2 |           1 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.112671
      3 |           2 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.117622

---

# Inner Join

Use `LEFT INNER JOIN` to combine data from multiple tables:

```sql
SELECT c.id as customer_id,
       o.id as order_id,
       c.name as customer_name,
       o.placed_at as ordered_at
FROM customers c
LEFT INNER JOIN orders o on c.id = o.customer_id;
```

    .terminal
     customer_id | order_id | customer_name |         ordered_at
    -------------+----------+---------------+----------------------------
               1 |        1 | Paul Barry    | 2013-09-27 00:00:00
               1 |        2 | Paul Barry    | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.112671
               2 |        3 | John Doe      | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.117622
    (3 rows)

You can leave `left inner` out because it is the most common and the default

Notice Customer 3, Nowhere Man, is not in the result set

# Outer Join

Use `LEFT OUTER JOIN` to include rows where there is no match

```sql
SELECT c.id as customer_id,
       o.id as order_id,
       c.name as customer_name,
       o.placed_at as ordered_at
FROM customers c
LEFT OUTER JOIN orders o on c.id = o.customer_id;
```

    .terminal
     customer_id | order_id | customer_name |         ordered_at
    -------------+----------+---------------+----------------------------
               1 |        1 | Paul Barry    | 2013-09-27 00:00:00
               1 |        2 | Paul Barry    | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.112671
               2 |        3 | John Doe      | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.117622
               3 |          | Nowhere Man   |
    (4 rows)

The value `NULL` is returned for all the columns from the orders table when there is no match

# IS NULL

You can use `IS NULL` to filter down the results to only rows where the column is null

```sql
SELECT c.id as customer_id,
       c.name as customer_name
FROM customers c
LEFT OUTER JOIN orders o on c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.id is null;
```

In this case, the effect is that we get customers who have not placed an order:

    .terminal
     customer_id | customer_name
    -------------+---------------

# Distinct

Switching back to an inner join we get a row for each order:

```sql
SELECT c.id as customer_id,
       c.name as customer_name
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o on c.id = o.customer_id;
```

    .terminal
     customer_id | customer_name
    -------------+---------------
               1 | Paul Barry
               1 | Paul Barry
               2 | John Doe

Use `distinct` to eliminate duplicates:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.id as customer_id,
       c.name as customer_name
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o on c.id = o.customer_id;
```

    .terminal
     customer_id | customer_name
    -------------+---------------
               2 | John Doe
               1 | Paul Barry

# Count

Use `count(*)` to count how many records match the criteria:

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# SELECT count(*) FROM orders;
     count
    -------
         3
    (1 row)

    betastore_development=# SELECT count(*) FROM orders
    betastore_development-# WHERE placed_at > '2013-09-30';
     count
    -------
         2
    (1 row)

There are other aggregate functions available like `sum`, `avg`, `min` and `max`:

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# SELECT count(*), sum(price),
    betastore_development-# avg(price), min(price), max(price) FROM products;
     count |  sum  |        avg         | min  | max
    -------+-------+--------------------+------+------
         3 | 10.73 | 3.5766666666666667 | 2.99 | 3.99
    (1 row)

---

# Grouping

Use `GROUP BY` to group rows that have the same value together, useful for aggregate queries, such as this one that will give you the number of orders each customer has placed. 

```sql
SELECT count(*) as order_count, customer_id
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY order_count desc
LIMIT 10;
```

    .terminal
     order_count | customer_id
    -------------+-------------
               2 |           1
               1 |           2
    (2 rows)

In this example, `GROUP BY` is combined with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to create a top 10 list, but that isn't necessary, you can use `GROUP BY` by itself if you choose.

---

# Having

If you are looking for all customers with multiple orders, this doesn't work:

```sql
SELECT count(*) as order_count, customer_id
FROM orders
WHERE order_count > 1
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY order_count desc;
```

If you want to filter based on the result of an aggregation, use `HAVING` instead:

```sql
SELECT count(*) as order_count, customer_id
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING count(*) > 1
ORDER BY order_count desc;
```

You can use a combination of `WHERE` and `HAVING` to get, for example, all customers with multiple orders since 2013-09-30:

```sql
SELECT count(*) as order_count, customer_id
FROM orders
WHERE placed_at > '2013-09-30'
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING count(*) > 1
ORDER BY order_count desc;
```

---

# In

You can use `IN` to match multiple values.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE name in ('Muffin', 'Coffee')
```

This example returns all products named `'Smoothie'` or `'Coffee'`:

    .terminal
     id |  name  | price |         created_at         |         updated_at
    ----+--------+-------+----------------------------+----------------------------
      1 | Muffin |  2.99 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.033147 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.033147
      3 | Coffee |  3.99 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.039351 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.039351

---

# Like

You can use `LIKE` to do partial string matches, with `%` as the wildcard character:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE name LIKE '%o%';
```

This example returns all products with an `o` in their name:

    .terminal 
     id |   name   | price |         created_at         |         updated_at
    ----+----------+-------+----------------------------+----------------------------
      2 | Smoothie |  3.75 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.03724  | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.03724
      3 | Coffee   |  3.99 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.039351 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.039351

---

# And

You can combine multiple conditions together to for a WHERE clause with `AND`:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE name LIKE '%o%'
AND price > 3.75
```

This example returns all products whose name contains an `o` and have a price greater than 3.75:

    .terminal
     id |  name  | price |         created_at         |         updated_at
    ----+--------+-------+----------------------------+----------------------------
      3 | Coffee |  3.99 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.039351 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.039351

---

# Or

Similar to `AND`, but only one of the conditions has to be met for the row to be included

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE name LIKE '%o%'
OR price < 3
```

This example returns all products whose name contains an `o` or have a price less than 3:

    .terminal
     id |   name   | price |         created_at         |         updated_at
    ----+----------+-------+----------------------------+----------------------------
      1 | Muffin   |  2.99 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.033147 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.033147
      2 | Smoothie |  3.75 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.03724  | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.03724
      3 | Coffee   |  3.99 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.039351 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.039351

---

# Nested Conditions

You can combine `AND` and `OR` to build more complex queries. Use parentheses to control the precedence.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE price < 3
AND (name = 'Muffin' OR name = 'Coffee')
```

This example returns all products that have a price less than 3 and are named either `Muffin` or `Coffee`:

    .terminal
     id |  name  | price |         created_at         |         updated_at
    ----+--------+-------+----------------------------+----------------------------
      1 | Muffin |  2.99 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.033147 | 2013-09-30 18:17:46.033147

---

# Subqueries

You can use the results of one query to filter the results of another using a subquery:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE id in (SELECT customer_id FROM orders)
```

This example will return all customers who have placed an order:

.small[

    .terminal
     id |    name    |       email        |         created_at         |         updated_at
    ----+------------+--------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------
      1 | Paul Barry | mail@paulbarry.com | 2013-09-30 18:17:45.974852 | 2013-09-30 18:17:45.974852
      2 | John Doe   | test@example.com   | 2013-09-30 18:17:45.983197 | 2013-09-30 18:17:45.983197

]

Subqueries can often be expressed as a join instead, I recommend that whenever possible

---

# Insert

You can create new record using insert:

```sql
INSERT INTO customers (name, email, created_at) 
VALUES ('New Guy', 'new@example.com', now());
```

You can see the record was created and the id was auto-generated even though we didn't provide a value for it:

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# select * from customers order by id desc limit 1;
     id |  name   |      email      |         created_at         | updated_at
    ----+---------+-----------------+----------------------------+------------
      4 | New Guy | new@example.com | 2013-09-30 17:44:51.074779 |
    (1 row)

---

# Update

We can change that record with an UPDATE

```sql
UPDATE customers
SET name = 'New Person',
    updated_at = now()
WHERE id = 4;
```

After we run that statement, you can see the record has been updated if you select it again:

.small[

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# select * from customers order by id desc limit 1;
     id |    name    |      email      |         created_at         |         updated_at
    ----+------------+-----------------+----------------------------+----------------------------
      4 | New Person | new@example.com | 2013-09-30 17:44:51.074779 | 2013-09-30 17:50:55.170811
    (1 row)

]

---

# Delete

We can remove the record from the database with a DELETE:

```sql
DELETE FROM customers WHERE id = 4;
```

Now we can see that the most recent user is back to Nowhere Man:

.small[

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# select * from customers order by id desc limit 1;
     id |    name     |      email      |        created_at         |        updated_at
    ----+-------------+-----------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
      3 | Nowhere Man | man@nowhere.com | 2013-09-30 19:37:17.41708 | 2013-09-30 19:37:17.41708
    (1 row)

]
