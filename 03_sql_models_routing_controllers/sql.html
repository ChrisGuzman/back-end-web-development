# SQL

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language for querying Relational DataBase Management Systems (RDBMS) tables for data

---

# RDBMS

A Relational DataBase Management System is a server that stores data in related tables. There are several open source and proprietary RDBMSes, we will use PostgreSQL (often shortened to just Postgres) because it is open source and therefore free, has great features like full-text searching and GIS-related features and is well-supported by Heroku. MySQL is a popular open-source alternative to Postgres and is used for many large web applications including Facebook. SQLite is only for testing and embedded applications. I've used all of these database and prefer Postgres.

# Clients for Postgres

## Command Line

    .terminal
    $ psql -d betastore_development

or launch it based on the database configuration in your Rails app

    .terminal
    $ rails dbconsole

## GUI (Graphical User Interface) Clients

[Navicat Essentials for PostgreSQL](http://navicat.com/download/navicat-essentials#pgsql_essentials) - Lots of features, Free Trial, $10 license, also available in the Mac App Store

[PG Commander](https://eggerapps.at/pgcommander/) - Very clear/fast UI for querying, Free Trial, $39 license, also available in the Mac App Store

[PGAdmin - http://www.pgadmin.org](http://www.pgadmin.org) - Free/Open Source, Clunky on a Mac, maybe good on Windows/Linux?

[Induction](http://inductionapp.com/) - Free/Open Source, only for viewing data

In these slides, we will use `psql`, which is good to learn first and then you can choose to learn to use a graphical tool like Navicat/PG Commander later if you find it more convenient.

---

# psql

`psql` is the command-line tool that comes with Postgres for interacting with your database. It is similar to a bash or irb prompt in that you type commands, it prints the result and waits for you to type the next command. The default prompt in `psql` looks like this:

    .terminal
    betastore_development=#

That is the name of the database you are connected to followed by an `=` and a `#`. You can can out about what commands you can use within psql using the `help` command:

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# help
    You are using psql, the command-line interface to PostgreSQL.
    Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
           \h for help with SQL commands
           \? for help with psql commands
           \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
           \q to quit

---

# Tables

A table is a like a spreadsheet with data organized in rows and columns. You can query for the data in a table using a `SELECT` statement, like this:

.small[

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# SELECT * from subscriptions;
     id |      email       |         created_at         |         updated_at
    ----+------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------
      1 | test@example.com | 2013-09-24 00:45:24.755576 | 2013-09-24 00:45:24.755576
    (1 row)

]

When using `psql`, you must always end each statement with a `;`. If forget the `;`, that is ok, `psql` will allow you to enter it on the next line:

.small[

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# select * from subscriptions
    betastore_development-# ;
     id |      email       |         created_at         |         updated_at
    ----+------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------
      1 | test@example.com | 2014-03-05 01:44:58.602869 | 2014-03-05 01:44:58.602869
    (1 row)

]

This is because `psql` allows you enter a query on multiple lines and the `;` character indicates when you are finished with the query. You can see that the character before the `#` in the prompt changes to a `-` when you have started a query but haven't completed it with a `;` yet.

---

# Using Sublime Text with psql

You can edit your queries from within a `psql` session using Sublime Text. Type the command `\e` and press enter. This should bring up the last query you entered in Sublime Text. Change the query to look like this:

```sql
select email from subscriptions;
```

In Sublime Text, press `⌘+s` to save the file, then `⌘+w` close the file. This will take you back to the terminal and you will see that `psql` ran your query:

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# \e
          email
    ------------------
     test@example.com
    (1 row)

You can enter the command `\e` to pull up the query again in Sublime Text and then you can continue the cycle of editing, saving and closing the file to run different queries throughout your `psql` session.

---

# Displaying Results Vertically

As your tables get more complicated, they will have more columns and the output from psql will get hard to read, because it will be so wide that it will be forced to wrap. To make things easier to read, you can change the way the output is displayed to list one column per line. In some cases, this will be an easier way to read the data. The `\x` command toggles your `psql` session between these two modes:

.small[

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# select * from subscriptions;
     id |      email       |         created_at         |         updated_at
    ----+------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------
      1 | test@example.com | 2014-03-05 01:44:58.602869 | 2014-03-05 01:44:58.602869
    (1 row)

    betastore_development=# \x
    Expanded display is on.
    betastore_development=# select * from subscriptions;
    -[ RECORD 1 ]--------------------------
    id         | 1
    email      | test@example.com
    created_at | 2014-03-05 01:44:58.602869
    updated_at | 2014-03-05 01:44:58.602869

    betastore_development=# \x
    Expanded display is off.
    betastore_development=# select * from subscriptions;
     id |      email       |         created_at         |         updated_at
    ----+------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------
      1 | test@example.com | 2014-03-05 01:44:58.602869 | 2014-03-05 01:44:58.602869
    (1 row)

# Records

A database can have multiple tables and data is organized into tables that relate to each other.

A row in a database is often also referred to as a **record**.

## Primary Keys

A primary key is a column value that is unique within the table

In Rails, this is always a auto-incrementing integer called `id`, as is the case in this example

---

# Schema

In an RDMBS, you must create the structure of each table before you can create records in the table. You define which columns a table is allowed to have and what the columns are named. We can look at which tables exist in the database using the `\dt` command in `psql`:

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# \dt
                 List of relations
     Schema |       Name        | Type  | Owner
    --------+-------------------+-------+-------
     public | schema_migrations | table | paul
     public | subscriptions     | table | paul

Using Rails generators and migrations, we have already created the subscriptions database table. The schema_migrations table was also created by Rails. It is used to keep track of which migrations have already been run. We will cover migrations in more detail in the lesson on Active Record.

---

# Database Normalization

We should organize our data into tables in a way that minimizes duplication. This process is referred to as **database normalization**.

## First version of our orders table

Let's say we are going to create a table to allow us to keep track of orders to our store. We will need the information about who placed the order and what products they ordered. So a naive first attempt at creating at table for this might look like this:

    .terminal
    id | customer_name | customer_email     | placed_at  | products         |
    ---+---------------+--------------------+------------+------------------+
    1  | Paul Barry    | mail@paulbarry.com | 2013-09-27 | Muffin, Smoothie |
    2  | Paul Barry    | mail@paulbarry.com | 2013-09-30 | Smoothie         |
    2  | John Doe      | test@example.com   | 2013-09-30 | Muffin, Coffee   |

## Problems

There are multiple products in the products column, which will make it hard to query. We have also repeated the name of the product in multiple places. Also, the customer name and email are repeated in multiple rows.

What are we going to do if a customer wants to change their email address? Or if we rename a product? When designing a database schema, you always want to minimize the duplication of data so that if you need to change a value, you only have to change it in one place.

---

# Each column should contain only one value

We can create another table called line items to store

    .terminal
    orders
    id | customer_name | customer_email     | placed_at
    ---+---------------+--------------------+-----------
    1  | Paul Barry    | mail@paulbarry.com | 2013-09-27
    2  | Paul Barry    | mail@paulbarry.com | 2013-09-30
    3  | John Doe      | test@example.com   | 2013-09-30

    line_items
    id | order_id | product_name | product_price
    ---+----------+--------------+--------------
    1  | 1        | Muffin       | 2.99
    2  | 1        | Smoothie     | 3.75
    3  | 2        | Smoothie     | 3.75
    4  | 3        | Muffin       | 2.99
    5  | 3        | Coffee       | 3.99

---

# Foreign Keys

In the `line_items` table, the `order_id` is called a **foreign key**

Foreign keys are commonly used to create relationships between tables

    .terminal
                        line_items
    orders              ----------
    --------------      id
    id             <--- order_id
    customer_name       product_name
    customer_email
    placed_at

---

# Remove Product Duplication

Our `line_items` table was a step in the right direction, but we still have duplication of the product information like name and price. Let's break out `products` into a separate table:

.small[

    .terminal
    orders
    id | customer_name | customer_email     | placed_at
    ---+---------------+--------------------+-----------
    1  | Paul Barry    | mail@paulbarry.com | 2013-09-27
    2  | Paul Barry    | mail@paulbarry.com | 2013-09-30
    3  | John Doe      | test@example.com   | 2013-09-30

    line_items
    id | order_id | product_id
    ---+----------+--------------
    1  | 1        | 1
    2  | 1        | 2
    3  | 2        | 2
    4  | 3        | 1
    5  | 3        | 3

    products
    id | name      | price
    ---+-----------+-------
    1  |  Muffin   | 2.99
    2  |  Smoothie | 3.75
    3  |  Coffee   | 3.99

]

---

# Relationship Diagram

Now the structure of our tables looks like this:

    .terminal
                        line_items
    orders              ----------
    --------------      id              products
    id             <--- order_id        --------
    customer_name       product_id ---> id
    customer_email                      name
    placed_at                           price

A table like the `line_items` table is often referred to as a **join table**, because it has foreign keys to both the `orders` table and the `products` table and serves as the link between those two tables.

---

# Remove Customer Duplication

We still have duplicate customer information, so let's break that out into a separate `customers` table in the same way we did with our `products` table:

    .terminal
    customers
    id | name       | email
    ---+------------+--------------------
    1  | Paul Barry | mail@paulbarry.com
    2  | John Doe   | test@example.com

    orders                              line_items
    id | customer_id | placed_at        id | order_id | product_id
    ---+-------------+------------      ---+----------+--------------
    1  | 1           | 2013-09-27       1  | 1        | 1
    2  | 1           | 2013-09-30       2  | 1        | 2
    3  | 2           | 2013-09-30       3  | 2        | 2
                                        4  | 3        | 1
                                        5  | 3        | 3
    products
    id | name      | price
    ---+-----------+-------
    1  |  Muffin   | 2.99
    2  |  Smoothie | 3.75
    3  |  Coffee   | 3.99

---

# Relationship Diagram

    .terminal
                                       line_items
                   orders              ----------
    customers      --------------      id              products
    ---------      id             <--- order_id        --------
    id        <--- customer_id         product_id ---> id
    name           placed_at                           name
    email                                              price

The `orders` table now has a foreign key to the `customers` table:

# Denormalization

    .terminal
                                       line_items
                   orders              ----------
    customers      --------------      id              products
    ---------      id             <--- order_id        --------
    id        <--- customer_id         product_id ---> id
    name           placed_at           quantity        name
    email          total_amount        price           price

In an e-commerce system like the one we are building prices of products will undoubtedly change over time. We need to keep a record of the price of the a customer paid for a product when they placed the order. To support this, a technique called **denormalization** is useful.

Denormalization is the opposite of what we just did. It is the process of putting data in multiple places. In this case, we are going to store the price of a product with the line item, for historical purposes. The price in the line items table will not be changed if we change the price of a product. This makes it a good candidate for denormalization because there is still only one place we have to make a change if the price of a product changes.

Another reason to denormalize is to improve performance. Let's say we want to sort all orders by their total amount. We could calculate the total amount for each order and then sort them, but that might be slow once we have a lot of orders. Since the total amount of an order doesn't change, we can calculate it once when the order is placed and then save it into a column on the order.

**This type of performance-improvement-based denormalization should only be used once you are sure you need it**. It is a mistake to do this when you are first creating your application because you don't even know yet if you will need to sort orders by their total amount.

# Entity-Relationship Diagram

Here is the final structure of our database tables:

.center[![ERD](img/erd.png)]

This type of diagram is often referred to as an Entity-Relationship Diagram, or ERD for short

---

# Creating Tables with Rails

So we want to create our tables so they look like this:

    .terminal
                                       line_items
                   orders              ----------
    customers      --------------      id              products
    ---------      id             <--- order_id        --------
    id        <--- customer_id         product_id ---> id
    name           placed_at           quantity        name
    email          total_amount        price           price

We can use Rails generators to do that for us. Run these commands in a bash shell in the directory of your Rails app:

.small[

    .terminal
    $ rails generate model customer name email
    $ rails generate model product name price:decimal
    $ rails generate model order customer:belongs_to placed_at:datetime total_amount:decimal
    $ rails generate model line_item order:belongs_to product:belongs_to quantity:integer price:decimal
    $ rake db:migrate

]

We will cover what these commands mean and the code they generate in more detail in the lesson on ActiveRecord.

---

# Creating Data with Rails

Replace the contents of the `db/seeds.rb` file in your Rails app with the following code:

.small[
```ruby
me = Customer.create(name: 'Paul Barry', email: 'mail@paulbarry.com')
test = Customer.create(name: 'John Doe', email: 'test@example.com')
Customer.create(name: 'Nowhere Man', email: 'man@nowhere.com')

muffin = Product.create(name: 'Muffin', price: 2.99)
smoothie = Product.create(name: 'Smoothie', price: 3.75)
coffee = Product.create(name: 'Coffee', price: 3.99)

order = Order.create(customer: me, placed_at: '2013-09-27')
LineItem.create(order: order, quantity: 1, product: muffin)
LineItem.create(order: order, quantity: 1, product: smoothie)

order = Order.create(customer: me, placed_at: Time.current)
LineItem.create(order: order, quantity: 1, product: smoothie)

order = Order.create(customer: test, placed_at: Time.current)
LineItem.create(order: order, quantity: 1, product: muffin)
LineItem.create(order: order, quantity: 1, product: coffee)
```
]

This code is using the code generated by the commands we ran in the previous slide to create data in our database. Use this command to run it:

    .terminal
    $ rake db:seed

If you need to reload the data for any reason, use this command:

    .terminal
    $ rake db:setup

---

# Let's Write Some SQL!

Use `rails dbconsole` to bring up `psql` connected to database:

    .terminal
    $ rails dbconsole
    psql (9.3.1)
    Type "help" for help.

    betastore_development=#

---

# See what a table looks like

Use the `\?` command to get a list of psql commands:

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# \?
    ...
           \d[S+]                 list tables, views, and sequences
           \d[S+]  NAME           describe table, view, sequence, or index
    ...

These are psql-specific commands, other clients and databases have different ones.

See what the **orders** table looks like:

.small[

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# \d orders;
                                          Table "public.orders"
        Column    |            Type             |                      Modifiers
    --------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------
     id           | integer                     | not null default nextval('orders_id_seq'::regclass)
     customer_id  | integer                     |
     placed_at    | timestamp without time zone |
     total_amount | numeric                     |
     created_at   | timestamp without time zone |
     updated_at   | timestamp without time zone |
    Indexes:
        "orders_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
        "index_orders_on_customer_id" btree (customer_id)

# Queries

Queries are made up of keywords, which I've put in CAPITAL LETTERS in the examples, which is a convention some people follow when writing SQL by hand. The 4 main types are queries are:

1. SELECT - For retrieving data

2. INSERT - For creating new rows

3. UPDATE - For updating existing rows

4. DELETE - For removing rows

---

# Select

`SELECT` queries are used to retrieve data

```sql
SELECT <column_names> FROM <table_name>
```

Use a `SELECT` query to get all of the orders

```sql
SELECT id, customer_id, placed_at FROM orders
```

Use `\e` to enter the query using Sublime Text. Once you save the file _(⌘+s)_ and close the tab _(`⌘+w`)_, you will see the result of the query in `psql`:

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# \e
     id | customer_id |         placed_at
    ----+-------------+----------------------------
      1 |           1 | 2013-09-27 00:00:00
      2 |           1 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.374823
      3 |           2 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.380245
    (3 rows)
    betastore_development=# \e
    ...

You can use `*` in place of column names to get all columns:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders;
```

---

# Where

Use the `WHERE` clause to filter the rows that are returned

```sql
SELECT id, customer_id, placed_at
FROM orders WHERE placed_at > '2013-09-30';
```

    .terminal
     id | customer_id |         placed_at
    ----+-------------+----------------------------
      2 |           1 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.374823
      3 |           2 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.380245
    (2 rows)

A query can be separated on multiple lines and must end with a `;`

---

# Limit

Use `LIMIT` to control how many rows are returned:

```sql
SELECT id, customer_id, placed_at
FROM orders LIMIT 1;
```

    .terminal
    id | customer_id |      placed_at
    ----+-------------+---------------------
      1 |           1 | 2013-09-27 00:00:00
    (1 row)

`LIMIT` can be combined with `WHERE`:

```sql
SELECT id, customer_id, placed_at
FROM orders WHERE placed_at > '2013-09-30'
LIMIT 1;
```
    .terminal
     id | customer_id |         placed_at
    ----+-------------+----------------------------
      2 |           1 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.374823
    (1 row)

---

# Order

Use `order` to control the order the rows are returned in

```sql
SELECT id, customer_id, placed_at
FROM orders ORDER BY placed_at desc;
```

    .terminal
     id | customer_id |         placed_at
    ----+-------------+----------------------------
      3 |           2 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.380245
      2 |           1 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.374823
      1 |           1 | 2013-09-27 00:00:00
    (3 rows)

The opposite of `desc` is `asc`, but it is the default and can be omitted:

```sql
SELECT id, customer_id, placed_at
FROM orders ORDER BY placed_at;
```

    .terminal
     id | customer_id |         placed_at
    ----+-------------+----------------------------
      1 |           1 | 2013-09-27 00:00:00
      2 |           1 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.374823
      3 |           2 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.380245
    (3 rows)

---

# Order

Can also be combined with WHERE and LIMIT:

```sql
SELECT id, customer_id, placed_at
FROM orders WHERE placed_at > '2013-09-30'
ORDER BY placed_at LIMIT 1;
```

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# \e
     id | customer_id |         placed_at
    ----+-------------+----------------------------
      2 |           1 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.374823
    (1 row)

You can order by multiple columns:

```sql
SELECT id, customer_id, placed_at
FROM orders ORDER BY customer_id desc, placed_at;
```

    .terminal
     id | customer_id |         placed_at
    ----+-------------+----------------------------
      3 |           2 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.380245
      1 |           1 | 2013-09-27 00:00:00
      2 |           1 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.374823
    (3 rows)

---

# Joins

Each order is related to a customer via the the `customer_id` foreign key:

    .terminal
                   orders
    customers      ------
    ---------      id
    id        <--- customer_id
    name           placed_at
    email

We want to get data from both of these tables in one query:

    .terminal
    customers
     id |    name
    ----+------------
      1 | Paul Barry
      2 | John Doe
      3 | Nowhere Man

    orders
     id | customer_id | placed_at
    ----+-------------+--------------------
      1 |           1 | 2013-09-27 00:00:00
      2 |           1 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.374823
      3 |           2 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.380245

---

# Inner Join

Use `JOIN` to combine data from multiple tables:

```sql
SELECT c.id as customer_id,
       o.id as order_id,
       c.name as customer_name,
       o.placed_at as ordered_at
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o on c.id = o.customer_id;
```

    .terminal
     customer_id | order_id | customer_name |         ordered_at
    -------------+----------+---------------+----------------------------
               1 |        1 | Paul Barry    | 2013-09-27 00:00:00
               1 |        2 | Paul Barry    | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.374823
               2 |        3 | John Doe      | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.380245
    (3 rows)

Notice Customer 3, Nowhere Man, is not in the result set

---

# Outer Join

Use `LEFT OUTER JOIN` to include rows where there is no match

```sql
SELECT c.id as customer_id,
       o.id as order_id,
       c.name as customer_name,
       o.placed_at as ordered_at
FROM customers c
LEFT OUTER JOIN orders o on c.id = o.customer_id;
```

    .terminal
     customer_id | order_id | customer_name |         ordered_at
    -------------+----------+---------------+----------------------------
               1 |        1 | Paul Barry    | 2013-09-27 00:00:00
               1 |        2 | Paul Barry    | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.374823
               2 |        3 | John Doe      | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.380245
               3 |          | Nowhere Man   |
    (4 rows)

The value `NULL` is returned for all the columns from the orders table when there is no match

---

class: center, middle

![Joins](img/joins.png)

---

# IS NULL

You can use `IS NULL` to filter down the results to only rows where the column is null

```sql
SELECT c.id as customer_id,
       c.name as customer_name
FROM customers c
LEFT OUTER JOIN orders o on c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.id is null;
```

In this case, the effect is that we get customers who have not placed an order:

    .terminal
     customer_id | customer_name
    -------------+---------------
               3 | Nowhere Man

---

# Distinct

Switching back to an inner join we get a row for each order:

```sql
SELECT c.id as customer_id,
       c.name as customer_name
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o on c.id = o.customer_id;
```

    .terminal
     customer_id | customer_name
    -------------+---------------
               1 | Paul Barry
               1 | Paul Barry
               2 | John Doe

Use `distinct` to eliminate duplicates:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.id as customer_id,
       c.name as customer_name
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o on c.id = o.customer_id;
```

    .terminal
     customer_id | customer_name
    -------------+---------------
               2 | John Doe
               1 | Paul Barry

---

# Count

Use `count(*)` to count how many records match the criteria:

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM orders;
```

    .terminal
     count
    -------
         3
    (1 row)

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM orders
WHERE placed_at > '2013-09-30';
```
     count
    -------
         2
    (1 row)

---

# Other Aggregate Functions

There are other aggregate functions available like `sum`, `avg`, `min` and `max`. Before we take a look at these, toggle into extended display mode:

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# \x
    Expanded display is on.

Now run this query:

```sql
SELECT count(*), sum(price), avg(price), min(price), max(price) FROM products;
```

You will see the following result:

    .terminal
    -[ RECORD 1 ]-------------
    count | 3
    sum   | 10.73
    avg   | 3.5766666666666667
    min   | 2.99
    max   | 3.99

You can switch back into non-extended display:

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# \x
    Expanded display is off.

---

# Grouping

Use `GROUP BY` to group rows that have the same value together, useful for aggregate queries, such as this one that will give you the number of orders each customer has placed.

```sql
SELECT count(*) as order_count, customer_id
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY order_count desc
LIMIT 10;
```

    .terminal
     order_count | customer_id
    -------------+-------------
               2 |           1
               1 |           2
    (2 rows)

In this example, `GROUP BY` is combined with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to create a top 10 list, but that isn't necessary, you can use `GROUP BY` by itself if you choose.

---

# Having

If you are looking for all customers with multiple orders, this doesn't work:

```sql
SELECT count(*) as order_count, customer_id
FROM orders
WHERE order_count > 1
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY order_count desc;
```

If you want to filter based on the result of an aggregation, use `HAVING` instead:

```sql
SELECT count(*) as order_count, customer_id
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING count(*) > 1
ORDER BY order_count desc;
```

You can use a combination of `WHERE` and `HAVING` to get, for example, all customers with multiple orders since 2014-03-01:

```sql
SELECT count(*) as order_count, customer_id
FROM orders
WHERE placed_at > '2014-03-01'
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING count(*) > 1
ORDER BY order_count desc;
```

---

# In

You can use `IN` to match multiple values.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE name in ('Muffin', 'Coffee');
```

This example returns all products named `'Smoothie'` or `'Coffee'`:

    .terminal
     id |  name  | price |         created_at         |         updated_at
    ----+--------+-------+----------------------------+----------------------------
      1 | Muffin |  2.99 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.317279 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.317279
      3 | Coffee |  3.99 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.323369 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.323369
    (2 rows)

---

# Like

You can use `LIKE` to do partial string matches, with `%` as the wildcard character:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE name LIKE '%o%';
```

This example returns all products with an `o` in their name:

    .terminal
     id |   name   | price |         created_at         |         updated_at
    ----+----------+-------+----------------------------+----------------------------
      2 | Smoothie |  3.75 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.32101  | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.32101
      3 | Coffee   |  3.99 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.323369 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.323369
    (2 rows)

---

# And

You can combine multiple conditions together to for a WHERE clause with `AND`:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE name LIKE '%o%'
AND price > 3.75;
```

This example returns all products whose name contains an `o` and have a price greater than 3.75:

    .terminal
     id |  name  | price |         created_at         |         updated_at
    ----+--------+-------+----------------------------+----------------------------
      3 | Coffee |  3.99 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.323369 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.323369
    (1 row)

---

# Or

Similar to `AND`, but only one of the conditions has to be met for the row to be included

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE name LIKE '%o%'
OR price < 3;
```

This example returns all products whose name contains an `o` or have a price less than 3:

    .terminal
     id |   name   | price |         created_at         |         updated_at
    ----+----------+-------+----------------------------+----------------------------
      1 | Muffin   |  2.99 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.317279 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.317279
      2 | Smoothie |  3.75 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.32101  | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.32101
      3 | Coffee   |  3.99 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.323369 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.323369
    (3 rows)

---

# Nested Conditions

You can combine `AND` and `OR` to build more complex queries. Use parentheses to control the precedence.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE price < 3
AND (name = 'Muffin' OR name = 'Coffee');
```

This example returns all products that have a price less than 3 and are named either `Muffin` or `Coffee`:

    .terminal
     id |  name  | price |         created_at         |         updated_at
    ----+--------+-------+----------------------------+----------------------------
      1 | Muffin |  2.99 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.317279 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.317279
    (1 row)

---

# Subqueries

You can use the results of one query to filter the results of another using a subquery:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE id in (SELECT customer_id FROM orders);
```

This example will return all customers who have placed an order:

.small[

    .terminal
     id |    name    |       email        |        created_at         |        updated_at
    ----+------------+--------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
      1 | Paul Barry | mail@paulbarry.com | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.29229 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.29229
      2 | John Doe   | test@example.com   | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.30248 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.30248
    (2 rows)

]

Subqueries can often be expressed as a join instead, I recommend that whenever possible

---

# Insert

You can create new record using insert:

```sql
INSERT INTO customers (name, email, created_at)
VALUES ('New Guy', 'new@example.com', now());
```

You can see the record was created and the id was auto-generated even though we didn't provide a value for it:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY id desc LIMIT 1;
```

    .terminal
     id |  name   |      email      |         created_at         | updated_at
    ----+---------+-----------------+----------------------------+------------
      4 | New Guy | new@example.com | 2014-03-06 05:22:03.000289 |
    (1 row)

---

# Update

We can change that record with an UPDATE

```sql
UPDATE customers
SET name = 'New Person',
    updated_at = now()
WHERE id = 4;
```

After we run that statement, you can see the record has been updated if you select it again:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY id desc LIMIT 1;
```

.small[

    .terminal
     id |    name    |      email      |         created_at         |         updated_at
    ----+------------+-----------------+----------------------------+----------------------------
      4 | New Person | new@example.com | 2014-03-06 05:22:03.000289 | 2014-03-06 05:23:16.854682
    (1 row)

]

---

# Delete

We can remove the record from the database with a DELETE:

```sql
DELETE FROM customers WHERE id = 4;
```

Now we can see that the most recent user is back to Nowhere Man:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY id desc LIMIT 1;
```

.small[

    .terminal
     id |    name     |      email      |        created_at         |        updated_at
    ----+-------------+-----------------+---------------------------+---------------------------
      3 | Nowhere Man | man@nowhere.com | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.30497 | 2014-03-06 09:47:20.30497
    (1 row)

]

# Exporting to CSV

One thing that you might find yourself needing to do is to export the data to CSV, so you can open it in a spreadsheet, share it with other people who don't have direct access to the database, etc.

Postgres allows you to use `COPY` to do this. For example, run this command from `psql` to copy the data from the orders table to a CSV file:

    .terminal
    betastore_development=# COPY orders TO '/tmp/orders.csv' CSV;
    COPY 3
    betastore_development=# \q

The file looks like this:

.small[

    .terminal
    $ cat /tmp/orders.csv
    1,1,2013-09-27 00:00:00,,2014-03-06 09:47:20.351343,2014-03-06 09:47:20.351343
    2,1,2014-03-06 09:47:20.374823,,2014-03-06 09:47:20.375697,2014-03-06 09:47:20.375697
    3,2,2014-03-06 09:47:20.380245,,2014-03-06 09:47:20.381082,2014-03-06 09:47:20.381082

]

You can now open this file in a spreadsheet program like Excel, Numbers, Libre Office, Google Docs, etc.

You can also use `COPY` to load data into a table from a CSV file. For more information on how to do that, read [the documentation for the COPY command][copy].

One thing to note is that the `COPY` command is not part of the SQL standard and will not work in other databases like MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, SQL Server, etc. Each of those databases have their own tools for exporting data.

[copy]: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/sql-copy.html
